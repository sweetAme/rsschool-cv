### 3. Bio ###
A second-year student at Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping. Specialization: Information security.  
I'm interested in information security in general, penetration testing, CTF events.  
Currently, web development is my main point of interest as I'm looking forward to work as a full-time web developer after graduation.  



Can call myself a fast learner and capable of working under a heavy workload.

### 4. Skills ###
I don't have any real work experience apart from my own small projects where I got some experience using Flask web framework with Jinja template engine
with Bootstrap 4 CSS framework to create basic websites with login/registration using MySQL/SQLite.  

For my other project, I worked with Telegram Bot API, basic HTML parsing using bs4 python library, and deploying my bot on AWS.  

From my university program, I'm familiar with C++ and C# 

### 5. Code example ###
